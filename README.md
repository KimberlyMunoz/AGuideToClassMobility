A Guide to Class Mobility!

Overview

Create a guide for people, primarily 14 - 17, or 18 - 24. People not served by the conventional means of getting a tech job (i.e. getting a CS degree - or you have an uncle that works in tech). Poor and working class people who have the motivation to be upwardly mobile, but don’t know how!

People are already well aware of the fact that someone can learn to code, and then hit it big. One liners like

Just make an app and sell it!

Programmers are the biggest up and coming highly paid professional group

Programming? There are online classes for that

Are rampant! But less common is advice on how exactly one would go from not knowing how to program at all, to being paid for it. This issue is exacerbated when you’re talking about low income being who don’t have very many resources to devote to starting a new career in the first place.

I want to fix that! A guide to class mobility will be a comprehensive guide for getting people from “just learned high school math” to “paid programmer”. I’m sure most of us know there are more steps there than just going over Python the Hard Way - and  I want to document those steps.

What do we Need?

Content [i.e. A 500 - 1000 word article about the bullet point in question]

Mentor Acquisition - where to find, scripts
Where to find, example (Game Dev help list) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9TlqTh1_29dEVSQ1d3YU80OFIyRGRWZklTM1pIWHc&usp=drive_web#gid=0
Scripts for finding a mentor, i.e. “Hey I’m working on this thing and I was wondering if you would be interested in giving me some feedback on it?”

Common pitfalls to avoid
Programming not linked into current interests
Technical barrier to entry (i.e. I tried to learn C++ as my first language)


Syncing programming with your other interests [i.e. Programming and: ]
design
astronomy 


Working on projects (personal or otherwise)

Personal stories / interviews (need question forms!)

Getting money for your work
